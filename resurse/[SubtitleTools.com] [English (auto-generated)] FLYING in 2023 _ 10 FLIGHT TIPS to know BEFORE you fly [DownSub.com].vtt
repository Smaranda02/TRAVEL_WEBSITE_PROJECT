00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.639
i've taken well over 100 flights and

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.279
still look forward to every single one

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.520
it's uninterrupted time to watch movies

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.240
read eat sleep think or whatever the

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.400
heck you like to do it could also be

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.080
rather terrible with you feeling anxious

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.920
and trapped at 30 000 feet in the air if

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.400
you aren't prepared let's avoid that

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
here are 10 super easy simple things

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
that you can do to make your next flight

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.260
the best flight

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.000
[Music]

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.640
this first point is so important once

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.239
you find your seat make sure that you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.320
store your carry-on luggage in the bin

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.040
directly above you or in front of you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
trust me when it comes time to get off

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.039
the plane you do not want your luggage

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.360
to be stuck in an overhead bin behind

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.440
you because you will need to wait for

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.120
all of those people that are sitting

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.680
further back to get off the plane before

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.840
you are able to go back there get your

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.480
carry-on luggage and de-plane yourself

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.800
and before you even board the plane make

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.160
sure you pack your carry-on

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.280
strategically with a mini carry-on this

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.360
is going to be the best way to optimize

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.840
the space at your seat i always have a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.159
small bag inside my main carry-on with

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.920
things that i want for the flight this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.640
includes my phone eye mask earplugs

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.880
water bottles snacks gum toothbrush

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.680
toothpaste and headphones so grab your

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.080
mini carry-on store your larger carry-on

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.400
in the overhead bin and get cozy without

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.720
that big bag taking up all of your foot

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.040
space speaking of headphones you are

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.200
going to want to bring wired headphones

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.920
with you i know who still has wired

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.759
headphones these days when we're all

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.479
carrying around these airpods the answer

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.320
should be you especially if you plan to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.920
fly in the near future because they are

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.000
not always given out for free on flights

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.159
these days so if you do want to use the

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.079
entertainment device on the seatback and

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.920
watch all of the new movies you will

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.079
need to bring your own set of headphones

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.320
or be prepared to pay at least five

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.399
dollars for a pair of rather terrible

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.040
headphones like i did on my last flight

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.840
last week from cancun to dubai five

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.079
dollars for these

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.600
and the headphones that you buy on the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.840
plane end up having two prongs you do

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.160
not need headphones like this the prong

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920
actually folds down and then you plug

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920
into the entertainment device with just

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.319
one so any old pair of wired headphones

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.920
that you can pick up before your flight

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.000
with just one prong like this is going

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.760
to work just fine with the seat back

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520
entertainment system also these

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
headphones that i got from euro rings on

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.760
my flight from cancun to dubai last week

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.840
were also extremely terrible and i could

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.680
barely hear anything that i was watching

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.599
on the screen until i took noise

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.920
cancelling headphones and put them on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.360
top of the earbuds so if you fly often

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.760
tip number four is to invest in a pair

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.160
of noise cancelling headphones even if

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.680
you don't want to watch a movie you can

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.519
put them on top of your airpods to

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.599
cancel out airplane noise or you could

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.599
even put them over earplugs to get some

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.239
sleep or meditate and hear absolutely

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.560
nothing around you if you don't already

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.840
own a pair of noise cancelling

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.920
headphones check out a used marketplace

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.000
like facebook marketplace or craigslist

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.159
and see if you can get a pair used at a

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.000
cheaper price for your next flight you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.519
also don't want to be relying on a

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.280
backseat entertainment system to keep

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.519
you occupied during your flight not that

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.120
many great movies have come out over the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.200
past few years and many budget airlines

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.959
don't even have tv screens for you

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.040
anymore if you are signed up to one of

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.519
the 100 streaming services like disney

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.840
plus or netflix you can download movies

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.599
or episodes of your favorite shows to

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.080
your phone your tablet or your laptop to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.480
watch offline if you do want to download

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.319
any content make sure you do it before

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.319
you leave your home the free wi-fi that

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.840
you can connect to at the airport is

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.519
probably not going to allow you to

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.360
download content especially not at the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.799
speed that you would need it to while

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.560
you're waiting to board your flight in

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.480
addition to movies and tv shows you can

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.480
also consider downloading podcasts or

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.480
audio books to your phone something else

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.360
i like to do is to download actual books

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360
it's a nice backup to have books audio

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.840
books and podcasts available even if you

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.159
end up watching a movie 90 of the time

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.760
comment down below what the last movie

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.680
was that you watched on an airplane i

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.080
watched cruella it was cute i like emma

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.000
stone something else to know if you are

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.599
flying this year that wouldn't have been

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.680
a problem a few years ago is that you

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.840
need to bring the correct charging cord

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.798
with you that is going to accept usbc if

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.478
you plan to charge your phone or any

00:04:18.478 --> 00:04:20.399
other devices while you're on the plane

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.079
and since so many of us are going to be

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.000
relying on our phone to show documents

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.240
or even to book an uber when we arrive

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.919
you're probably going to want to charge

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.680
your phone during the flight every

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.240
airplane i have ever been on has a usbc

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.160
charging port so that means that your

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.840
charger has to have

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.600
a it has to look like this usb c this is

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.520
important to know and plan ahead for if

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.639
you do have a fancy usba charging cord

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.280
for your phone like i do in addition to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.759
the standard usbc charging slot there is

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.080
also a plug that is often found

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000
underneath your seat so you could always

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.320
bring a plug with you and then charge

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.320
your devices that way as opposed to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.199
using the usbc charging slot on my most

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.039
recent flight the under seat plug did

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.720
not actually have any power running

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.240
through it and the flight attendant let

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.759
me know that it's very common for these

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.320
to be out of order in this case i also

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.720
had an adapter that was going to adapt

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.919
usb c a to usb c

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.960
c at which point i could charge my phone

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.639
if you're curious about what plugs and

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.240
amenities you're going to have at your

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.560
exact seat on your specific flight

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.320
definitely check out seekthrough

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.320
seatguru is a free website that's going

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.240
to show you exactly what you're going to

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.160
have at your seat to help you prepare

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.000
for your flight something that surprised

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.759
me on a recent flight from cancun to

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.280
frankfurt was that there were no

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.919
blankets provided even though the cabin

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.560
temperature still went sub-zero the next

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.800
tip is to prepare for all temperatures

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.280
by dressing in layers i often even bring

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.039
a winter toque with me even if i'm

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.199
flying from one warm destination to

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.039
another depending on the airline that

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.120
you're flying with it really can get

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.360
that cold while you're up in the air

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.639
even though there were no blankets

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.479
available those little pillows were

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.479
still provided at every seat if you

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.080
haven't tried putting it on your lower

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.199
back

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.000
very nice try it i have also noticed

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.800
that airline food is going downhill and

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.120
sometimes even on long-haul flights not

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.680
even provided to you for free so instead

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.240
of paying 15 for a disappointing meal on

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.919
the airplane with a very limited

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.520
selection i would recommend that you

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.039
pick something up at the airport that

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.639
you love and then bring it on the plane

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.039
with you instead you can bring any food

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.199
or drinks purchased after the airport

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.440
security checkpoint with you right onto

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.080
the plane with no limits or restrictions

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.759
you can also bring food and snacks from

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.600
home but remember that they will need to

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.680
go through airport security at which

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.360
point they're subject to the liquid

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.039
limit so you will need to make sure that

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.120
any food items brought from home are not

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.160
considered a liquid by tsa security so

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.240
this could be obvious things like soups

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.560
but also less obvious things like mashed

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.560
potatoes i don't know who considers

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.479
mashed potatoes a liquid but you

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.160
probably can't bring it through security

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.919
once you're up in the air and the seat

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.919
belt sign has been turned off make sure

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.319
you get up and walk around at least

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.080
every couple of hours there are often

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.840
spaces in between the cabins where you

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.280
have some room to do a little bit of

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.440
stretching as well trust me you will

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.840
feel so much better after a long flight

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.160
if you just take a few minutes every few

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.639
hours to get some movement in a bonus is

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.080
that you can walk around and see if

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.520
there are any better seats for you to

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.000
snag that potentially have a free road

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.080
with them and one of my favorite things

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.840
on many long haul flights is that at the

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.440
back of the plane there's often a

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.759
refreshment station with snacks water

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:33.759
and various other drinks available for

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.000
you to grab so take a walk to the back

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.599
of the plane and you might be pleasantly

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.360
surprised by what you find there and

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.120
even if there's nothing there well you

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.720
got some steps in and you're going to

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.720
feel better when you land this next

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.639
point is a good one too that you may not

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.960
think about set an alarm on your phone

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.280
for about two and a half hours before

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.120
you land you'll want to set the alarm

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.720
for about two and a half hours before

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.039
you land because it's about two hours

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.120
before landing that the airplane lights

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.960
are going to turn back on drinks are

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.039
going to be served and everyone is going

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.120
to be waking up and once everyone is

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.639
waking up and getting these drinks

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:08.479
getting ready for landing they are all

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.800
going to be rushing to the bathroom by

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.560
having an alarm set for two and a half

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.560
hours you have that extra 30 minute

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.720
window where you can get up brush your

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.680
teeth freshen up use the washroom before

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.000
the rush of everyone else trying to do

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.759
